# About Project

Music holds a significant place in human life with its diverse genres found worldwide. Music genre classification plays a pivotal role in delivering personalized recommendations and enhancing user experience across various multimedia applications. However, manually classifying music genres is a daunting task, necessitating an automated approach. In this study, we propose an automatic approach for music genre classification using machine learning techniques.

## Methodology

Utilizing the GTZAN dataset, we extracted various features from audio files. We then explored the performance of popular machine learning models, including:

- K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Support Vector Machine
- Artificial Neural Networks (NN)

## Results and Conclusion

The classification performance of each model was evaluated and compared using various metrics. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in music genre classification, paving the way for improved multimedia applications and user experiences.
